# react-instant-chat

This React Chat was built to gain experience and for possible use for a client project. 

To start the app, run:

```
npm install 

npm start
```

Once the webpack server has started you can access it in a browser at http://localhost:8000

Ensure that you also have the [simple-chat-api](https://github.com/kentandlime/simple-chat-api) running as well
